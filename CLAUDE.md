- Theme switching benefits from CSS variables and class-based approach
- API key management requires careful security consideration
- Stripe webhook handling requires idempotency and signature verification
- Usage tracking benefits from period-based design with automatic reset
- Pricing UI should clearly show savings for yearly plans
- Google OAuth for APIs requires careful scope selection and token management
- File change detection using checksums prevents duplicate processing
- Selection algorithms benefit from multiple strategies (random, chronological, usage-based)
- API route organization by feature (auth, folders, files, selection) improves maintainability
- Background tasks (scanning) should provide progress feedback
- Social platform APIs have widely varying requirements and limits
- Token encryption is essential for social platform credentials
